 Analysis Result

Score: 95/100  

Brief Fact-Check Summary:  
The claim that Lionel Messi, a professional footballer (soccer), will play in the Cricket Champions Trophy 2025 is false. Messi has no known history of professional cricket involvement, and the two sports (football and cricket) are entirely distinct in skills, leagues, and governing bodies. As of July 2024, Messi remains under contract with Inter Miami CF in Major League Soccer (MLS) and has not indicated any plans to switch sports. The Champions Trophy is a cricket tournament for national teams, requiring eligibility Messi does not possess (he is Argentine, not a citizen of a cricket-playing nation).  

Potential Red Flags:  
1. Sport/Profession Mismatch: Messi is a footballer with no ties to cricket.  
2. No Credible Sources: No official announcements from Messi, his team, or cricket bodies (e.g., ICC).  
3. Logical Implausibility: Transitioning to a new sport at age 37 (in 2025) is unrealistic.  
4. Sensationalism: The claim mimics clickbait trends involving celebrity cross-sport hoaxes.  

Suggested Verification Sources:  
1. Messi’s Social Media (Instagram/X): No such announcement exists.  
2. ICC Official Website: No player lists or eligibility updates include Messi.  
3. Reputable Sports Outlets: ESPN, BBC Sport, or Reuters have not reported this.  
4. Inter Miami CF Statements: Confirms Messi’s ongoing football commitments.  

This claim is almost certainly fabricated, likely for engagement farming or satire.
